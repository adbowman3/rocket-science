# Summary

This repository contains

* A modern mini-application for simulating solid rocket motors using an
  object-oriented, functional programming style in Fortran 2018.
* A legacy motor simulator demonstrating the solution of the same governing
  equations using a procedural programming style in Fortran 77/90.
* A refurbished motor simulator demonstrating one modernization path for
  making the legacy solver object-oriented but without the radical redesign
  that affords the above purely functional programming style.

The simulator includes a capability for launching gnuplot to compare results
of the three solvers.

# Statement of need

The most highly cited article on refactoring Fortran is "Refactorings
for Fortran and high-performance computing" [@overbey2005refactorings].

# Governing Equations

Rockets obey the second law of motion of Isaac Newton:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
   \vec{F} = \frac{ d\vec{p} }{ dt }
\end{equation}
